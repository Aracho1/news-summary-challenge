# News Summary challenge

Check out (here)[makers-news-today.surge.sh]

I have built a single-page web app that summarises the news using the Guardian API and Aylien APIs, using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

Since the Aylien API has a low API request limit (as it is directed via Makers API), in case of API fetch failure, I have replaced the summary text with the full article body.
